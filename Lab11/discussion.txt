1. 78 bytes

2. At the start of add funtion the memory allocation is started.
   After stopping the main function the memory is freed.

3. Take two student_t type pointers.(temp and now). Assign last node to now and travel
   along the list and check the E number.If the E number of the first node is same as the 
   wanted E number, assign temp pointer to now -> next node and free now node.Then re assign 
   as last = temp
   If we want to delete the last node assign the next of previous node as NULL and free it.
   If we want to delete a middle node assign the temp as now -> next and delete the now node.

4. Yes.

5. I think array based system is suitable for this situation. Because we know the size of
   the array and we know the number of students which we want to add.
   And also if we want to do implement it is easy to use a array based system rather 
   than usind a linked based system.
