1) 52000 bytes

2) The memory allocation is happened before the main function is executed. After the main function is stopped the memory allocation is freed.

3) To delete a records for a student, the values which is in next element of the student_t array are assigned to that element which we want to delete. 
   Then the records in the next element are assigned to the that element. This process is done until the last record. 

4) No. We can add only 1000 amount of student data to this program.

5) When we want to insert a student record, first we can allocate the space in the memory, then add the records to that space.
   We can continue this process for each turn of inserting a student record.
   When we want to delete a student record, we can free that allocated space.
   By using this method we can resize an array while the program is running. We can do this dynamin memory allocation by using the malloc() function and
   we can free allocated memory by using free() function.
